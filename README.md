# cs370_nutrition_tracker
This project will build a Nutrition Tracker Web Application. 
The app will include a user interface where people can input their daily meal plans/nutrition intake, 
search for food information and past records, get weekly reports, and get suggestions based on current nutrition plans. 
This application will provide users with a single space to store and track their nutritional information, 
which could easily be overlooked. By using a food tracker, people can become more aware of what they are consuming, 
ultimately improving overall health.
